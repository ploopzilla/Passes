# Passes
A repository to track created goob gang passes.

## Introduction

In the vast expanse of the universe, before the dawn of time, an emptiness prevailed. Then, as if by a cosmic quirk, the first Shoob Pass emerged, igniting a chain reaction in the otherwise serene void. This momentous event heralded the birth of the Goob Gang, a fellowship destined to echo through the annals of time.

Among them were legends, each unique in their own right. Shoob, the wise and mischievous, whose pass first pierced the silence of the cosmos. Goobie, the daring adventurer, whose zest for life knew no bounds. But they were not alone in this dance of destiny.

There was Sas, the enigma, whose Sas Pass brought a layer of mystery and intrigue to every exchange. Jamms, the melody weaver of the gang, whose Jammz Jingle resonated with the joy and rhythm of life itself. And Constant, the anchor, whose Constant Coin symbolized the unyielding strength and reliability amidst the whirlwind of their escapades.

Together, this motley crew of cosmic comrades navigated the newfound power of the passes. The Shoob Pass, the harbinger of this new era, was soon joined by the Sas Pass, the Jammz Jingle, and the Constant Coin, each weaving their own unique thread into the fabric of the Goob Gang's history.

However, with great power came great confusion. The once simple life of the Goob Gang spiraled into a complex tapestry of passes, favors, and playful commands. The essence of their camaraderie was buried beneath a burgeoning pile of untracked promises and forgotten debts.

In a stroke of genius, a solution emerged from the chaos - a GitHub repository. This digital ledger was to be the guardian of order, a meticulous record keeper of the passes within the Goob Gang. Now, every pass exchange, every whimsical request, and every playful command is meticulously documented in this sacred digital space. The Goob Gang, standing at the threshold of a new era, finds themselves rediscovering the joy of their unique bond, their friendship strengthened by the very tool that records their delightful anarchy.

Thus, in this repository lies not just a list of passes but a chronicle of adventures, a testament to the unbreakable bond of the Goob Gang. Here, order and chaos dance in harmony, and the spirit of the Goob lives on, immortalized in the annals of the internet, echoing the laughter and camaraderie of the greatest gang the universe has ever known - The Goob Gang.
