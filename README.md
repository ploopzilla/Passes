2. If you don't have git installed, look up how to install it.
3. Clone this repository on your local - git@github.com:ploopzilla/Passes.git
4. Change into the Passes directory and run a git status to ensure you correctly have git installed.
5. Changes are simple, before making any changes, you need to open up a Pull Request and have it approved by an existing Codeowner before mergine it to master. If you wish to be added as a Codewner contact @ploopzilla for further information.
6. Once you have cloned this repository to your local, create a new branch. You can do that by running the following git command - git checkout -b <branch-name> <branch-to-track>. For example if I wanted to create a branch that tracks the master branch I would run git checkout -b myBranch origin/master.
7. Make your changes locally. When you have decided you have completed your changes, add your files by running git add <filename>, commit your files by running git commit -m"enter commit message". Finally push to your branch - git push origin myBranch.
8. Navigate over to the Pull Requests section and click Create New Pull Request and in the following page, select your branch. Add a meaningful title and description and wait for an approving reviewer to approve it.
9. Once approved you can go ahead and merge it, and once merged your passes are live! You may use your passes as you wish.
